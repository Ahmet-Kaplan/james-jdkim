Release 0.1
-------------------

jDKIM is a DKIM implementation library written in Java. It provides both verification and signing
and also provides Mailets for the Apache JAMES project.

The 0.1 release is the first release. It requires Java 1.4 at runtime but for full compliance with
the DKIM specification the JVM running the library must support SHA256withRSA cypher suite.
The default Sun Java 1.4 does not support this suite, so either you move to Java 1.5+ or you 
install a third party cryptography provider like BouncyCastle and configure it appropriately in 
your JVM.

The architecture is thought to handle multiple signatures with performance in mind: body hashing
for multiple signatures is computed concurrently in a single stream run.

The whole internal verification/signing is dove via OutputStream leaving much more flexibility than
the use of InputStream. As the InputStream approach is easier from the user side the default
implementation simply prepare the OutputStream and copy the supplied InputStream to the OutputStream.

In order to reduce depencencies and to not reinvent the wheel the resulting library includes a
"shaded" version of the commons-codec 1.4 classes needed to do Base64 encoding/decoding.

Notes
-----

 * jDKIM API is still considered unstable and is likely to change in future releases
 * Code is likely to be updated to Java 1.5 before a final release.
 * Default parsing is done using mime4j 0.5 parser (0.6 is Java 5 only, so we stuck to 0.5).
 * The mailet does rely on javamail parsing instead of mime4j.
 * Make sure to use dnsjava 2.0.7 or greater as 2.0.6 has a bug in TXT record escaping.
